### Requirement Analysis

- I own a multi-storey parking lot that can hold up to 'n' cars at any given point in time.

- Each slot is given a number starting at 1 increasing with increasing distance from the entry point in steps of one.

- I want to create an automated ticketing system that allows my customers to use my parking lot without human intervention.

- When a car
  enters my parking lot, the ticket will be issued to the driver.

- The ticket issuing process includes documenting the registration number (number plate) and the colour of the car
  and allocating an available parking slot to the car before actually handing over a ticket
  to the driver (we assume that our customers are nice enough to always park in the slots
  allocated to them).

- The customer should be allocated a parking slot which is nearest to the entry.

- At the exit the customer returns the ticket which then marks the slot they were
  using as being available.

- Due to government regulation, the system should provide me
  with the ability to find Out:
- Registration numbers of all cars of a particular colour.
- Slot number in which a car with a given registration number is parked.
- Slot numbers of all slots where a car of a particular colour is parked.
